### General Info
***
This project consists in the realization in C of a simplified TCP/IP client/server application. It will consist in the realization, on one side, of a server which will query a documentary fund (text file which simulates a data base) containing information on books under the format (reference#author#title#genre#number_of_pages#appreciation), on the other hand, a client that will be able to exchange with the user to retrieve his requests and then exchange with the server via the TCP/IP protocol to retrieve the necessary data and then display them to the user.
